title: OneMap updated vignettes
description: Fancy version of OneMap tutorials from my github repository
---


We, from Statistical Genetics Lab at ESALQ-USP, frequently update the OneMap tutorials. They are in my github repo ("Cristianetaniguti/onemap"). Install this version of OneMap with:

devtools::install_github("Cristianetaniguti/onemap")

Then, use R to acess the package internal  vignettes or use the links:

* [How to build a linkage map for inbred-bases populations (F2, RIL and BC)](http://cristianetaniguti.github.io/onemap/vignettes_highres/Inbred_Based_Populations.html)

* [How to build a linkage map for outcrossing populations](http://cristianetaniguti.github.io/onemap/vignettes_highres/Outcrossing_Populations.html)

**Warning**: These vignettes are being updated together with the package. Before follow their instructions, check if your OneMap version is the same of my repository. For other OneMap versions these vignettes can not be useful.
